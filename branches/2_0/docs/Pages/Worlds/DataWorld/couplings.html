  <h1>Coupling</h1>
  <p><a href="../../Network/Couplings.html">Coupling</a> a network to a Data World is fairly simple: one specifies a column for the neuron to affect or be affected by. For input neurons input is determined by the value in the specified column of the currently selected row. The activation of output neurons is used to set the value of the specified column of the currently selected row. </p>
  <p>For exampe, if an input neuron is coupled to column number  5 of a Data World, and the third row of that Data World was selected, then when the network is iterated, the neuron would take on the value in the third row and fifth column of the Data World. If the neuron was sending Output Commands to column number 5, and the third row of the Data World was selected, then the third row and fifth column of the Data World would take on the neuron's activation when the network is iterated. </p>
