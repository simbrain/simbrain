    <p><h1>Spike Responders</h1></p>
    <p>Synapses whose source neuron is a <a href="../spikingnetworks.html">spiking neuron</a> are called spike responders.</p>
  <p>In general, when a spike arrives at a post-synaptic cell (the target neuron of the spiking neuron), a &quot;wave&quot; of activation is created. This is modeled using a &quot;response function&quot; which characterizes a synaptic current, the influx of chemicals into a target cell which occurs when vesicles are released from a source neuron. </p>
  <p>Formally, while the <a href="common.html#wtdinput">weighted inputs</a> to a target neuron are usually computed by taking the sum of the source activation times weights at time <em>t</em>, if the source neuron is a spiking cell that term is replaced by:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>weight(<em>t</em>) x response function(<em>t</em>)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is to say, what is passed on to the post-synaptic neuron is the value of the response function scaled by the strength of the weight. That being said, there are a number of unique response functions that dramatically change the utility of the spike interaction. The response function can be thought of as the wave form of the response to a spike.</p>
