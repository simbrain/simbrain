<body> The <b>simbrain.util.environment</b> package contains a simple 2-d environment model with
smell sensors, simple motion, and very simple touch.  The main thing this package current supplies is 
a model of smell, where a set of chemicals disperses in an environment and an agent's receptors
pick these chemicals up.

There are two interfaces, TwoDEnvironment and TwoDEntity, which users of this package must
implement.   Agents (which can be loaded with various sensors and effectors), and smell sources
are classes which can be added to objects which use this package.

The package depends on workspace currently.  Perhaps the two could be decoupled.
