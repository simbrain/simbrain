<h1>Network</h1>
<p>Networks
are built by creating neurons and connecting them with synapses. They
are run by pressing the "play" or "step" button (see the <a href="Network/quickref.html">quick reference</a>). For a sense of what the colors, circles, etc. signify see the discussion of <a href="Network/visualConventions.html">visual conventions</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>There are a variety of different <a href="Network/neuron.html">neurons</a>
and <a href="Network/synapse.html">synapses</a>,
each with their own rules and parameters. By combining these together
you can create indefinitely many different kinds of networks. There are
also special types of networks called "<a href="Network/subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a>"
which can be added to a simulation. Different subnetworks can be linked
together, leading to even more complex and powerful simulations.</p>
<p>There are also connection objects, layout objects, model groups and
other functions which can be used to build neural networks.<br>
</p>
<p>Shown
below is a simple neural network. The colored circles with numbers in
the middle represent simplified neurons or "nodes." The lines between
nodes represent synaptic connections between neurons which direct the
flow of activity in the network. The smaller blue and red discs at the
ends of these lines represent synaptic connections. </p>

<p align="left"><a name="RunningNet"></a>When
Simbrain is first opened nothing happens. A sample network sits
passively before the user. When the user "runs" the network it comes to
life--an <a href="Network/network_op.html">update algorithm</a> is
repeatedly called, which is visible in the form of spreading activity
in network's nodes and (if learning is activated) changing weight
sizes. The network can be run by pressing pressing the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18"> in the tool-bar to
repeatedly iterate the network. Note that the image on the button
becomes that of a "stop" button <img src="../Images/Stop.gif" height="18" width="18">.
Pressing this button will stop the network. Thus the play/stop button
acts as a toggle switch. You can also press the step button <img src="../Images/Step.gif" height="18" width="18">
(or press "space") to iterate the network a single time. Sometimes
repeatedly hitting the space bar is useful way to test a network.</p>
