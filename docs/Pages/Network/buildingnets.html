  <p></p><h1>Building and Editing Networks</h1>
  <p>Network
editing in Simbrain is modeled on a familiar "draw" interface which
involves creating screen elements, copying, and pasting.</p>
<p class="heading"><a name="NewNode"></a>Creating nodes. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">To create a node:</span> Nodes are created by pressing "P" or by pressing the new node button <img src="../../Images/New.gif" height="18" width="18"> in the toolbar. They will be created at the last position clicked on-screen. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">To create a line of neurons.</span>
Repeatedly pressing "P" or the new node buttuon results in a line of
nodes being created beginning at the last clicked position.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">To create a specific type of neuron.</span>
By default, new nodes are Binary. The default node type cannot
currently be changed, though this is planned. To create a node of a
specific type, simply create a new node, set its properties, and change
its type. To create many nodes of a specific type, create a node, set
its type, and then copy and paste repeatedly. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">To create networks or groups of neurons.</span> Subnets are created using <span class="command">new &gt; new network</span>.
Subnets and small groups of neurons can be created, copied, and
repeatedly pasted to quickly create many sets of similar elements. </p>

<p class="heading"><a name="ConnectNodes"></a>Connecting nodes.</p>

<blockquote><br>
  <span class="heading2">Keyboard shortcut method</span><br>
  <br>To quckly connect neurons:<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Set source neurons (select and then keyboard 1)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Set target neurons (using the standad selection mechanism / the green lasso)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Connect (keyboard 2)<br>
  <br>
This method works well.&nbsp; You wil get used to it quickly and then
use it: select source &gt; 1 &gt; select&nbsp; target &gt; 2.&nbsp; It
goes fast.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <span class="heading2">Menu method</span><br>
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - select source neurons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - menu connect &gt; set as source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - select target<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - menu connect &gt; connect-source-target &gt; all to all<span class="heading2"><br>
Simple Connect Method<br>
<br>
  </span>
  <p><span class="heading2">To connect a group of source nodes to one target node</span>: Select one or more "source" nodes, then right-click on a target neuron and select <span class="command">connect nodes</span> from the pop-up menu. </p>


  
  <p><span class="heading2">To connect a chain of nodes, one to another</span>: Enter build mode, and single click in the following pattern: source, target 1, target 1, target 2, target 2, target 3,...</p>

<p class="heading"><a name="SelectNodes"></a>Selecting nodes</p>
<p> Neurons and weights can be selected so that operations can be
performed on the selected group of items (e.g., randomizing selected
items, adjusting them up or down, etc.). Selecting neurons and weights
is important, because many Simbrain operations apply to selected sets
of weights and/or nodes. The selection interface basically works the
way most computer drawing programs work. Use the left-click button to
"lasso" or "rubberband" screen items. Once some items are selected, you
can hold down the shift key and single-click to fine tune your
selection. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Selection mode</span>: All
selection operations must be done in selection mode, the default mode,
which is entered by pressing "S" or the selection button <img src="../../Images/Arrow.gif" height="18" width="18">.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Lasso</span>: Left-click and drag the lasso around screen items you want to select. As items are selected a box appears around them.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Single click</span>: Single left-click on nodes and weights to select individual screen items. Zooming in on items can facilitate this.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Shift key </span>:
Once some items are selected, you can hold down the shift key to add
more items to your selection. Hold down Shift while lassoing to add or
remove groups items; hold down Shift while single-clicking to add or
remove single items. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading"><a name="SettingPref"></a>Setting Properties</p>
<p>Some detailed properties are set using a dialog box. Other
properties, e.g. activation values for neurons and strengths for
weights, can be set using keyboard and toolbar commands.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Calling set properties dialog:</span> Select the neurons or weights you want to change and:</p>
  <p>1) 
    double-click on of the selected items<br>
    2)  
    right-click and select <span class="command">set properties</span> in the popup menu<br>
    3) select <span class="command">network &gt; edit &gt; set neurons</span> or <span class="command">network &gt; edit &gt; set weights</span></p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Setting properties of multiple objects</span>.
Select the objects you want to modify. If you select both weights and
neurons, which preference dialog comes up depends on which kind of item
you click on. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Set activation values</span>:
The activation value (and hence color) of neurons and the excitatory or
inhibitory strength (and hence color and size) of weights can be
manually adjusted. To do so, select one or more neurons and weights
(both can be adjusted at the same time), and press the up and down
arrow keys to increase or decrease these values. The amount increased
or decreased is set by the "increment" field. Right and left arrow keys
can also be used to increase or decrease these value. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Clearing and randomizing values</span>:
Note that while screen items are selected, neuron values can also be
set to zero by pressing "C" on the keyboard (weight values are not then
set to zero, because this is equivalent to deleting them, which can be
done with the delete key). Pressing "R" will randomize all selected
screen items, neurons and weights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading">Moving Nodes </p>
<p>Simply left click and drag the selected items, as you would a window
or any other screen item. Groups of items can be moved by selecting and
left-click dragging them. For fine tuning, users can also use the arrow
keys (with Shift held down) to "nudge" selected items. </p>
<p class="heading"><a name="CopyPaste"></a>Copy, Cut and Paste</p>
<p>Selected items can be copied, cut, and paste similarly to the way
they are on most contemporary GUI's. Lasso select groups of items, then
fine tune your selection using SHIFT to add or remove items. Simbrain
will automatically select all valid subnetworks (all nodes and all
selected connections which couple selected nodes; i.e. "free-floating"
connections will not be selected). </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>	Copy, copy, and paste in one of the following ways </p>
  <p>1) Use standard shortcuts: control-C (copy), control-X (cut), control-V (paste).<br>
    2) Use the network menu and select copy, cut, or paste. <br>
    3) Right-click on one of the selected items and select copy or cut</p>
