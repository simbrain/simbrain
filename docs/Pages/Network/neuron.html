	<p /><h1>Neurons</h1>
	<p>Neurons
or "nodes" are represented by circles. The numbers inside the neurons
corresponds to their "activation level." (What this level represents
varies with neuron type: in many cases it can be thought of as
representing the rate of a firing of a neuron.) Visibly, these numbers
are rounded; functionally, however, the exact value is used. This exact
value can be seen by lingering over a neuron or double clicking on it.
The color of a neuron represents whether the activation is: greater
than 0, red; less than 0, blue; or equal to 0, white. These color
conventions can be customized, as described in the <a href="network_prefs.html">preference dialog</a>.
The closeness of the neuron's activiation level to the neuron's upper
or lower bound is visualized by the intensity of the color. </p>
	<p>There
are a variety of different neuron types in Simbrain, each of which has
numerous parameters that can be set. This page addresses properties
common to all of the different neuron types. Details on particular
neuron types can be found on their respective pages. </p>
	<p class="heading">Setting Neuron Properties </p>
	<blockquote>
	<p>Neuron parameters can be adjusted as follows:</p>
	<blockquote>
      <p><span class="heading2">Setting single neurons: </span>Double click on a neuron or right click on it and select set properties.</p>
      <p><span class="heading2">Setting multiple neurons:</span>
Select more than one neuron, and either double click on one of the
neurons, or select set properties from the popup or network menu. A
multiple neuron dialog box will appear. If the selected neurons are of
different types, only the common properties appear. Otherwise all
properties appear. Consistent properties are shown, inconsistent
properties are marked by a null string: ". . ." Changes you make will
apply to all selected neurons. </p>
      
    </blockquote>

    <p class="heading">Common Neuron Properties</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p class="heading2">Activation</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The
current level of activity of this neuron. How this should be
interpreted is dependent on the neuron type and application (e.g.
firing rate, voltage potential, etc.). This is represented by the
neuron's color, and can be seen exactly by lingering over the neuron or
observing the value in the neuron's properties. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="heading2">Increment</p>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>This
sets the amount that a neuron is incremented when it is manually
adjusted. For example, if increment is set to .1, then each time the up
arrow is pressed the neuron will increase its activation by .1. This
feature does not affect the neuron while the network is being iterated.</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p class="heading2"><a name="UpBound" id="UpBound" />Upper bound</p> 
	<blockquote>
	  <p>This
field plays different roles depending on the type of the neuron
(documented accordingly) but in general it determines the maximum level
of activity of a node. It also determines the range of colors which a
neuron can take on. The upper and lower bound determine the bounds of
randomization.</p>
  </blockquote>
	<p class="heading2"><a name="LowBound" id="LowBound" />Lower bound</p> 
	<blockquote>
	  <p>This
field plays different roles depending on the type of the neuron but in
general it determines the minimum level of activity of a node. It also
determines the range of colors which a neuron can take on.</p>
    
	</blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading"><a name="clipping"></a>Clipping</span></p>
<p> If a neuron uses clipping, then if its activation exceeds its  upper or lower bound, the activation is set to the upper or lower bound that it exceeds. Similarly with weights and their strength. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="heading"><a name="clamping" id="clamping"></a>Clamping</p>
<p>In general, a clamped synapse or node will not change over time; it is &quot;clamped&quot; to its current value. There are two ways to clamp neurons and synapses in Simbrain. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) Set the type  of a synapse to <a href="synapse/clamped.html">clamped synapse</a> or the type of a neuron to <a href="neuron/clamped.html">clamped neuron</a>. This allows specific subsets of synapses or neurons to be clamped.<br> 
    </p>
  <p>(2) In the <a href="toolbar.html">Toolbar</a> or <a href="menu.html#MenuEdit">Edit menu</a>, select &quot;Clamp weights&quot; or &quot;Clamp neurons.&quot; These cause <em>all</em> weights or synapses in a simulation to be clamped. This is useful when, for example, training a Hopfield network. You clamp the neurons at a value, then run the network to train the weights. Then you unclamp the neurons and clamp the weights, to test the network's memory. This method applies to the network globally, in that the neurons or synapses are not individually set to be clamped. The advantage of this method is that it allows you to temporarily turn off learning to focus on activation dynamics, or temporarily block activation change in order to focus on weight dynamics. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that some <a href="subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a> override clamping, in particular when they manually train their weights. Also note that the activation of a clamped neuron can be changed by using the up and down keys, and similarly with clamped weights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="heading"><a name="wtdinput" id="wtdinput"></a>Weighted Input </p>
<p>Each input to a node can have different amounts of influence on that node. The amount of influence that an input has is called the &quot;weight&quot; of that input. We represent the weight of the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> input by <em>w</em><sub>i</sub> and the activation level from the <em>i</em><sup>th</sup> node by <em>a</em><sub>i</sub>. The weighted input is then: 
<p align="center"><img src="equations/weighted.gif" width="167" height="75">
<p>Note that a sensory input term <em>I</em> is also added to the weighted input if the node has a <a href="couplings.html">sensory coupling</a> attached to it. </p>
<p>When a source neuron is a spiking neuron (see <a href="spikingnetworks.html">spiking networks</a>) the weight times activation term for that neuron is replaced by something more complex. See <a href="spikingnetworks.html">spiking networks</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Weighted input&quot; is also referred to as &quot;net input&quot; in much of the connectionist literature. To make a neuron whose acitvation value equals its weighted input, use a <a href="neuron/linear.html">linear neuron</a> with slope = 1 and bias = 0. </p>
