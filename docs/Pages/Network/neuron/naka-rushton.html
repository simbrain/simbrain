  <p><h1>Naka-Rushton Neuron</h1></p>
  <p>With this activation function, <a href="../common.html#wtdinput">weighted inputs</a> to a neuron are interpreted as stimuli intensities and the  activation of the neuron is interpreted as a spike rate. For standard values of its parameters there is a gradual increase in firing until the neuron fires near its maximum rate. </p>
<p>The activation of this type of neuron will tend to follow a  value <em>S</em>(<em>W</em>) which is defined as:</p>
<p><img src="../equations/NakaRushton1.png" width="316" height="99"></p>
<p>In this equation <em>W</em> is weighted inputs, <em>u </em>is upper bound (which here represents maximum spike rate), <em>N</em> is steepness, and sigma is the semi-saturation constant. This is roughly a sigmoidal function with a lower asymptote of 0 and an upper asymptote of <em>u</em>. This is realistic because the number of times a neuron fires in an interval of time is always non-negative. </p>
<p>The way in which the activation value <em>a</em> is made to follow <em>S</em>(<em>W</em>) is by making  <em>S</em>(<em>W</em>) the fixed point of the simple differential equation: </p>
<p><img src="../equations/NakaRushton2.png" width="183" height="78"></p>
<p> The time-constant tau controls the rate at which the activation tends to the fixed point. </p>
<p class="heading">Adaptation</p>
<p>If useAdaptation is set to true, then the activation (spike rate) will tend towards zero.  This models &quot;spike rate adaptation,&quot; according to which neurons have finite resources which prevent them from rapidly spiking indefinitely. </p>
<p>Adaptation is modeled by adding an adaptation variable <em>A</em>, which increases the steepness of the sigmoidal-like function <em>S</em> by increasing the semi-saturation constant, and thereby moving the fixed point of the activation function towards its minimum value. </p>
<p><img src="../equations/NakaRushton_Adaptation.png" width="353" height="99"></p>
<p><em>A</em> is a function of the activation of the neuron:</p>
<p><img src="../equations/NakaRushton_Adaptation2.png" width="191" height="72"></p>
<p>So the neuron will &quot;adapt&quot; more rapidly when it is firing more. Adaptation is controlled by its own time constant, tau-A, which should be much larger than tau, so that the adaptation will occur more slowly than the overall evolution of the firing rate. </p>
<p>The value of <em>A</em> can be observed via the tool tip on a neuron's graphical representation. </p>
<p>Both differential equations are implemented by integrating a differential equaton using the Euler method. The time-step of the Euler method is a global variable.</p>

<p class="heading">Steepness</p>

  <p>This value, denoted by <em>N</em> above, controls the steepness of the sigmoidal-like function S(<em>W</em>).</p>

<p class="heading">Semi-saturation constant</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This value, denoted by sigma above, is the point at which <em>S</em>(<em>W</em>) reaches half of its maximum value. It affects both steepness and the location of the inflection point. For small values of sigma, <em>S</em> is approximately a step function; for large values the function becomes less steep and the location of the inflection point increases. </p>

<p class="heading">Time constant </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This value, denoted by tau above, controls  the rate at which the activation tends to the fixed point <em>S</em>(<em>W</em>).</p>

<p class="heading">Use Adaptation </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If this is set to true, spike rate adaptation (described above) is utilized. </p>

<p class="heading">Adaptation Time Constant </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This value, denoted by tau-A above, controls the rate at which the adaptation variable tends to its minimum value. </p>

<p class="heading">Add Noise</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>If this is set to true, random values are added to the activation via a <a href="../noisegenerator.html">noise generator</a>. The random values are added after the activation is computed. TODO: Revisit computation of this relative to time-step. </p>
