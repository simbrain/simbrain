<p>Neurons
or "nodes" are represented by circles. The numbers inside the neurons
corresponds to their "activation level." (What this level represents
varies with neuron type: in many cases it can be thought of as
representing the rate of a firing of a neuron.) Visibly, these numbers
are rounded; functionally, however, the exact value is used. This exact
value can be seen by lingering over a neuron or double clicking on it.
The color of a neuron represents whether the activation is: greater
than 0, red; less than 0, blue; or equal to 0, white. These color
conventions can be customized, as described in the <a href="network_prefs.html">preference dialog</a>.
The closeness of the neuron's activiation level to the neuron's upper
or lower bound is visualized by the intensity of the color. </p>

<p><strong>Zero neuron </strong>: a neuron with a value of 0
represents a <em>non-</em>active
neuron, which is either not firing or is firing at a very low rate. In
terms of voltages, this can be thought of as a neuron which is at its <em>resting
potential</em>,
that is, which has its baseline electrical charge, which is actually
typically around -70mV (millivolts). In Simbrain this corresponds to
the color 0. </p>

  
<p><strong>Positive activation</strong>: a
neuron with positive activation can be thought of as firing at above
its normal rate. In terms of voltages, this can be thought of as a
neuron which is <em>above</em> its resting potential, e.g. -50mV. Such
a neuron is sometimes said to be "excited" or "depolarized." In
Simbrain this corresponds to a shade of red by default. </p>

  
<p><strong>Negative activation</strong>:
it is hard to say what a neuron with negative activation corresponds to
in terms of firing rates. In terms of voltages, this can be thought of
as a neuron which is <em>below</em> its resting potential, e.g. -50mV.
Such a neuron is sometimes said to be "inhibited" or "hyperpolarized."
In Simbrain this corresponds to a shade of blue by default. </p>

  
<p><strong>Excitatory synapse</strong>:
a weight with a positive value corresponds to an excitatory synapse.
When these synapses are activated the post-synaptic neuron is <em>more</em>
likely to fire, they "heat things up," as it were. An excitatory
synapse is one which releases excitatory neurotransmitters, which bind
to channels post-synaptically which cause currents that lead to an
increase in the post-synaptic voltage potential. AMPA synapses are a
common type of excitatory synapse. Excitatory synapses are shown as red
discs in Simbrain. </p>

  
<p><strong>Inhibitory synapse</strong>: a
weight with a negative value corresponds to an inhibitory synapse. When
these synapses are activated the post-synaptic neuron is <em>less</em>
likely to fire, they "cool things down," as it were. An inhibitory
synapse is one which releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, which bind
to channels post-synaptically which cause currents that lead to a
decrease in the post-synaptic voltage potential. GABA synapses are a
common type of inhibitory synapse. Inhibitory synapses are shown as
blue discs in Simbrain.</p>

  
<p><strong>Zero synapse</strong>: a weight with a value of 0 is a way
of mathematically representing the <em>absence of</em> a connection.
In Simbrain this is currently represented as blue, inhibitory. </p>

  
<p><strong>Net input </strong>:
the net input to a neuron represents, roughly, the summation of
excitatory and inhibitory signals, from excitatory and inhibitory
synapses, at the cell body. </p>

  
<p><strong>Bias</strong>: the bias of a neuron can be thought as its
base-line firing rate or its resting potential.</p>

  
<p><strong>Clipping / Upper and Lower Bounds</strong>: There are
upper and lower limits on the firing rate (in hertz) or voltage
potential (in mV) of a neuron.</p>
