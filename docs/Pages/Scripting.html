<h1>Scripting</h1>
<br>
<p>To produce custom simulations or behaviors not possible using the Simbrain GUI, you can
either create scripts.</p>

<p>All scripts are currently <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/docs.html">beanshell</a>
scripts (there is nothing to prevent other scripting languages, but
none have been implemented yet). See http://www.beanshell.org/docs.html</p>

<p>The best way to get a feel for scripting is to have a look at a few
scripts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try opening a few in the scriptmenu directory, and
also running them, to see how to do things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try modifying
them in simple ways (e.g. modifying the paramters at the top) and
re-running them.&nbsp; An example is sample-barchart.bsh.<br>
</p>
<p>All public objects in the Simbrain code can be accessed via these
scripts.&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, the scripts by default have access
to two variables:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">workspace</span>: the underlying model of all components in simbrain</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">desktop</span>: the graphical object which displays a workspace.</p>
<p>Often you will provide some code get access to an object and themodify those objects.<br>
</p>
<p>
The syntax for these scripts is java (with some modifications).&nbsp;
In each case some base object is made available that you can modify
using java commands. The best way to learn how to write these scripts
is probably to just look (and modify)&nbsp; existing scripts. <br>
</p>

<p>You can interact with scripts in different ways.</p>

<p><span class="heading">From Menus</span></p>
<p>One way to use a script is to edit it directly with a&nbsp; text
editor (Eclipse and other editors can have java syntax coloring
enabled), and then to invoke the script from the Simbrain
Gui.&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases there are <br>
</p>
<p>The {Simbrain}/script directory and its subdirectories contains
beanshell scripts.&nbsp; You are encouraged to add your own
scripts.&nbsp; This is your entry point for customizing Simbrain.<br>
<br>
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span class="heading2">Scriptmenu</span>:
Scripts in ./scriptmenu automatically appear in the "scripts" menu of
the Simbrain workspace.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this directory to create
actions that run custom simulations.&nbsp; The two objects available
here are "<span style="font-weight: bold;">workspace</span>" and "<span style="font-weight: bold;">desktop</span>", which give access to the
current org.simbrain.workspace.Workspace object, and the gui
representation via an org.simbrain.workspace.gui.SimbrainDesktop object.<br>
<br>
<span class="heading2">Network</span>: Scripts in ./network&nbsp;
automatically appear in the "scripts" menu of Simbrain network
components&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this directory to create custom actions that
can be applied to a current network (e.g., methods of adding neurons,
modifying neurons or synapses, etc.)&nbsp; The two objects available
here are "network" and "networkPanel."&nbsp; These give access to the
current org.simbrain.network.interfaces.Rootnetwork and its gui
representation via an org.simbrain.network.gui.NetworkPanel.<br>
<br>
<span class="heading2">Console</span>: scripts in ./console are
available from the Simbrain console (from which command line arguments
can be issued) or terminal components. The objects available here are
the same as with scriptmenu.</div>
<p><span class="heading"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span class="heading">In the Console</span></p>
<p>Beanshell commands can also be invoked in real-time from the command
line, which is available in special console windows or in a tab of the command window at the bottom of the simbrain desktop.</p>
<p>The console can be useful to quickly test or debug Simbrain. For a
sense of some things you can do in the console enter "help(); or
"tips();".<br>
</p>
<p>The console is similar to a UNIX or DOS terminal window.&nbsp; You
can navigate around the file system using commands like "cd();"</p>
<p>To run a script from the console, using the source command, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="command">source("sparseNetwork.bsh");&nbsp;  </span> <br>

<p>Can't use 2d arrays<br>
Can't use generics.</p>

<p><span class="heading">Editing Beanshell Scripts in Eclipse<br>
</span></p>
<p>In Eclipse, to get the syntax coloring, try Prefs &gt; Editors &gt; File associations &gt; add .bsh &gt; java editor<br>
</p>
<br>
<p><span class="heading">Example</span></p>

<p>Here is an example of a simpel script to create a few neurons conneted by a synapse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, have a look <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neuron neuron1 = new Neuron(network, "SpikingThresholdNeuron");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neuron1.setLocation(2,2);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network.addNeuron(neuron1);<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neuron neuron2 = new Neuron(network, "SpikingThresholdNeuron");<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neuron2.setLocation(50,2);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network.addNeuron(neuron2);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; network.addSynapse(new ClampedSynapse(neuron1, neuron2));<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desktop.getDesktopComponent(networkComponent).postAddInit();<br>
