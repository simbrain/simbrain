<p><span class="heading">Running a simulation</span><br>
<br>
To run a simulation use the iterate <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="step" src="../../Images/Step.png"> and play <img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="play" src="../../Images/Play.png">&nbsp; buttons in the main desktop toolbar.</p>
<p>On each iteration an update occurs, which essentially means all the
components and couplings are updated. &nbsp; The workspace time is
iterated, the components are all updated, and the couplings are
updated. &nbsp; There are various
types of update, and you have some control over how the update happens<br>
</p>



<span class="heading2"></span>
<p>
</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Time:</span>&nbsp;When a simulation is run iterations or "simulation time" are
tracked.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time is represented in the toolbar, and can
be reset to 0 by double clicking on the text label.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Updating From Terminal</span><br>



An alternative method is to use a&nbsp; terminal component&nbsp; or
in the terminal tab at the bottom of the desktop.&nbsp; The command
workspace.iterate(<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>) can be use to iterate the workspace <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> times.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="heading">Managing and Customizing Workspace Update</span><br>
</p>


<p>Workspace updates occur according to a default buffered update
strategy, but this can be customized in various ways.&nbsp; Sometimes
it is important that components and couplings be updated in a very
specific way over time.</p><p>On
any update the actions listed in the current update sequence panel will
be instantiated in the order shown.&nbsp;&nbsp; To customize the way
update happens, open the workspace dialog and click on the update
tab.&nbsp; This is what you will see:<br>

</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Current Update Sequence</span>: The current
list of update actions.&nbsp; On a given iteration of the workspace the
actions in this list will be fired in the order they are
listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order can be changed by dragging the actions
around in the subpanel.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Unused update actions</span>:&nbsp; Actions you can add to the update sequence.You
can move actions between the current and unused panels by selecting
actions in the unused panel and clicking "add selected actions"</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Add selected action(s): </span>&nbsp;Adds any selected actions in the unused update actions to the&nbsp; current update sequence.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Remove selected actions(s):  </span>For
selected actions in the current update sequence, move them to unused
update actions.&nbsp; For actions in the unused update actions, remove
them altogether.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Add Custom action: </span>&nbsp;Create&nbsp; a custom update action.&nbsp;&nbsp; A script editor opens up, with comments that indicate
how to go about creating the custom updater.&nbsp; Users have access to the underlying <span style="text-decoration: underline;">workspace</span> object and the gui <span style="text-decoration: underline;">desktop</span>.&nbsp; See  <a href="../Scripting.html">scripting</a> for more on how to create these scripts.&nbsp; To edit a custom action just double click on it.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="heading2">Changing update order. </span>&nbsp;To change the order of update actions, drag them around in the update sequence panel.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="heading">Types of Update Action</span><br>
</p>




<p>There are four kinds of action currently.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Buffered Update of all components and couplings</span></p>
<p>Update order does not matter. The default sequence of events is: <br></p>

<ul>
  <li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update all workspace components</li>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update all couplings (uses a buffer so that update order does not matter.)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In this scheme, the impact of a coupling is "felt" after an
iteration of the workspace, since coupling's producer value must first
update to a buffer, then the consumer is updated on the next iteration.</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Update Component</span></p>
<p>This action updates a single component.<br>
</p>
<p><span class="heading2">Update Coupling</span></p>
<p>This action updates a coupling, pulling the producer value and
applying it to the consumer.&nbsp; By combining component and coupling
updates in specific orders sequences of actions can be created that are
not asynchronous and do not have a time lag in the way buffered update
does.&nbsp;&nbsp; But care must be taken since when new componentss and
couplings are added they will not automatically be put in the current
update sequence.<br>
