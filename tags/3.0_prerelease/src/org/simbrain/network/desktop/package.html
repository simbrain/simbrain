The <b>simbrain.network.desktop</b> package contains code that is compiled for the Simbrain desktop app,
but that is <i>not</i> compiled for non-desktop usage.  See, for example, the networkjar task in build.xml.
Functions isolated to this package mostly involve (1) dependencies on workspace gui functions, or (2) 
UserPreferences, which do not work in applets.
