The <b>gui.trainer</b> package contains components that can be used to display trainer. TrainerPanel
is the default widget, but a custom trainer panel can be built using the other panels here.  Various
actions are in TrainerGuiActions, that can be used to make buttons for displaying and editing data,
showing a plot, etc.
