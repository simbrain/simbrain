  <p></p><h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups</h1><blockquote>
  
  <p>These
are&nbsp; logical groupings of neurons and / or synapses, and of other
groups. &nbsp; There
are many reasons to collect neurons and synpases together into more
organized sets.&nbsp; For
example, it can be useful to move specific groups of neurons around as
a unit, or to randomize or otherwise permute them.&nbsp; It is also
useful to be able to associate some groups of elements with special
operations and data structures. Perhaps the most important groups are <a href="subnetwork.html">subnetworks</a>, which are discussed separately. <br>
</p>
  <p>Here is an example of a group, a backprop network, which is itself
comprised of 5 subgroups: 3 neuron groups and 2 weight groups.&nbsp;
You can click on any of&nbsp; the interaction tabs and the associated
elements will be selected.&nbsp; This can be useful for randomizing,
moving, and deleting elements.<br>

  <p><span class="heading">Interaction Box</span><br>
  </p>
  <p>Groups are distinguished by being surrounded by a gray line,
with
a special tab, often in the upper left-hand corner. This box is the your
interface with the subnetwork and its properties.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Single Click</span></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Single clicking on the interaction box
of a group highlights all of that groups nodes and / or
weights.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can be dragged around as a unit,which is
often very convenient.&nbsp; They can also be modified by any comand
that only modifies selected elements. For example they can be
randomized, incremented, decremented (using the up and down arrows) or
"cleared" (set to 0).</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Right click&nbsp; / Group Actions</span><br>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">By right-clicking on a group's interaction box various actions
arise.&nbsp; Many of these are customized to a particular group
type.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Double Click</span></p>



  
  <blockquote>
  <p>If
you double-click on the subnetwork tab it calls up that network's
properties dialog, if a property dialog is defined for that group.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>

  </p>
<p><span class="heading">Default Group Actions</span><br>

  </p>
  
  <p>&nbsp;All groups have the following default actions defined:<br>
  </p>


  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Remove group<br>
</span></p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>Delete the group and all its constituents.<br>
 </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="heading"><span class="heading2">Edit group name<br>
</span></p>


  <blockquote>
  <p>Edit the name of the group which appears in the interaction tab.<br>
 </p>
  </blockquote>


  <span class="heading2"></span><br>
  <p><span class="heading">Neuron and Synapse Groups</span></p>

  
  <p>Neuron Groups and synpase groups can be created from existing
collections of neurons or synapses.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be useful for
organizing a complex network.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Neuron Group</span><br>
  </p>

  
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To create a neuron group <a href="buildingnets.html#SelectNodes">select</a> the neurons&nbsp; you want to add to the group and in the network or popup menu select&nbsp;Edit &gt; Group &gt; Neuron Group.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Synapse Group</span><br>
  </p>

  <span class="command"></span>
  
  <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To create a synpase group select the syanpses you want to add to
the group and in the network or popup menu select&nbsp;Edit &gt; Group
&gt; Synapse Group.</p>
