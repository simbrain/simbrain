<h1>Neuron Layouts</h1><br>
<p>Layouts refer in the most simple sense to how any group of neurons
is
positionally organized in a Simbrain network window. Currently three
layout types are possible (plus an additional type not accessable in the GUI), and can be applied to any selected set of
neurons or specified before the creation of a subnetwork.<br>
</p>
<p>Specifically, subnetworks are initialized with a pre-defined
number of neurons laid out in an appropriate manner. There are
typically several options, or layout styles, which are described here.
To choose a layout style, click on the <span class="command">Layout</span>
tab of the initialization dialog that appears when you create a new
subnetwork. (Shown below and to the right).<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> In each case below,
"initial position" corresponnds to the last
position clicked on screen, or the upper left corner if no position has
been clicked (this is the same as with neurons). Examples of each kind of layout can be found below the pictures below.</p>

<p class="heading">Grid</p>
<p>Neurons are laid out in a grid, beginning at an initial position and
moving downward.<img style="width: 175px; height: 120px;" src="../../Images/gridProperties.png" align="right"> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Number of columns:</span> How many columns
there will be in the grid.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Horizontal Spacing between neurons</span>:
Distance between the neurons from left to right. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Vertical Spacing between neurons</span>:
Distance between the neurons up and down. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="heading">Line</p>
<p>Neurons are laid out in a line, beginning at an initial position.
<img style="width: 175px; height: 95px;" src="../../Images/lineProperties.png" align="right"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Layout Style</span>: Whether the neurons
are laid out horizontally or vertically.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Spacing between neurons</span>: Distance
between the neurons.</p>
  <p><br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> </blockquote>
<p><span class="heading"></span><span class="heading"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="heading">Hexagonal <br>
</span></span></p>
<p>Neurons are laid out in a hexagonal pattern.<img style="width: 175px; height: 120px;" src="../../Images/hexgridProperties.png" align="right"><br>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="heading2">Number of columns:</span> How many columns
there will be in the grid.</p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Horizontal Spacing between neurons</span>:
Distance between the neurons from left to right. </p>
  <p><span class="heading2">Vertical Spacing between neurons</span>:
Distance between the neurons up and down. </p>
</blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="heading"></span></span></p>
<p class="heading">Layers</p>
<p>Currently, subnetworks that have
subnetworks as parts use the "layers" layout. It cannot be selected and
is thereby invisible to the user. This layout establishes all
subnetworks in lines that stack from bottom to top. </p>
