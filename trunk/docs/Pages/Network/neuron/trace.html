  <p><h1>Trace Neuron</h1></p>
  <p>The Trace neuron is a special type of neuron designed primarily to interact with the <a href="../synapse/trace.html">trace synapse</a>. It is based on Sutton and Barto's 1981, &quot;Towards a Modern Theory of Adaptive Networks: Expectation and Prediction,&quot; which prefigures a broad body of contemporary research into reinforcement learning, and is, to some extent, superceded by &quot;temporal difference&quot; models.</p>
  <p>The neuron involves two variables, the standard activation variable and what is called a trace, or eligibility trace, computed in a manner similar to the <a href="../neuron/runningaverage.html">running average</a> neuron. The synapses connected to a Trace neuron are only updated when the trace neurons they are connected to have a positive non-zero trace, which described as being &quot;eligible.&quot; The trace rises and decays with stimulus activity, and with this behavior in mind, the trace can be described as a moving window of opportunity for synaptic change.</p>
  <p>The neuron's activation is its <a href="../common.html#wtdinput">weighted input</a> <em>W</em> .</p>
  <p>The trace <em>y </em>is updated as follows:</p>
  <p><img src="../equations/traceNeuron.png" width="136" height="43">  </p>
  <p>It is assumed that c1 and c2 are between 0 and 1, and that c2 = 1-c1. (Note that these parameters allow one to implement Sutton and Barto's Equations (4) as well as (3), in the latter case by setting c2 to 0.)</p>
  <p>The trace of a neuron can be observed in a trace neuron's tooltip, and can also be observed by attaching a trace neuron to a linear neuron via a <a href="../synapse/signal.html">signal synapse</a>, and placing &quot;get trace&quot; in its label field.</p>
  <p>The trace neuron also contains special methods to get the difference between the neuron's trace and its activation, which functions as a kind of measure of surprise--how different is the neuron's current value from the running trace of its past values? Two methods gauge this: getDifference and getDifferenceHistory, which can also be plugged in to the label field of a signal synapse. The trace synapse uses getDifferenceHistory.</p>
