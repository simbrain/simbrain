  <h1>Timing </h1>
  <p>There are two general types of neuron and synapse in Simbrain, those based on numerical integration of a differential equation, and those based on simple iteration of an algorithm. We call these &quot;continuous&quot; and &quot;discrete&quot; neurons, respectively.</p>
  <p>Neurons which are continuous have a time-step field. The time step is a global variable which is used whenever differential equations are numerically integrated. When a continuous neuron or synapse is used, an iteration of the network represents an interval of time whose length equals the <span class="command">time-step</span>. Generally speaking, the smaller the time-step, the more accurate the numerical integration. </p>
  <p>If there is a single continuous neuron or synapse in a simulation, the network panel will display time in &quot;seconds.&quot; Otherwise time is displayed in &quot;iterations.&quot; </p>
