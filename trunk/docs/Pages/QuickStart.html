<h1>Simbrain Quick Start<br>
</h1>
<p class="heading">Some quick things you can do to see things happen... </p>
<p>1: Open different workspaces using <span class="command">File &gt; Open Workspace</span> (open the .zip files) and press play <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18"> in the in the workspace toolbar to see what happens.</p>
<p> 2: Run different scripts using the  the <span class="command">Scripts</span> menu and either press the buttons in the button panel that appears, or press play <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18"> in the in the workspace toolbar to see what happens.</p>


  


  
<p>To get rid of everything in the workspace,  use <span class="command">File &gt; Clear Workspace</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>

  
<p class="heading">Add networks to the workspace
  </p>

<p>Click the network button <img src="../Images/Network.png" height="18" width="18">
in the main toolbar a few times. You should see a few networks show up.
You can move them around however you like and resize them.<br>
 </p>

  
<p class="heading">Add neurons to a network </p>

  
<p>Click in one of the networks you created. Now create some neurons, by presing the <img src="../Images/AddNeuron.png" height="18" width="18">button
or using the "p" key. Do this a few times to create a line of neurons.
(For all network key commands, the network window must be selected for
the command to work)<br>
 </p>

  
<p class="heading">Select  those neurons </p>

  
<p>
  </p>
<p>Use
the mouse the draw a lasso around the neurons so that they are
selected. You can also press the "n" button to select all neurons.
Green halos will show up around these neurons signifying that you have
selected them. </p>

  
<p class="heading">Randomize the neurons </p>

  
<p>With the neurons selected, press the randomize button <img src="../Images/Rand.png" height="18" width="18"> or pressing "r".  Do this a few times to get a sense of what happens when neurons are randomized. </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Copy and paste some   neurons </span></p>

  
<p>Select some neurons, copy them using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Copy</span> (or control/command-C), click where you want to put a copy of those neurons, and then paste them there using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Paste</span> (or control/command-V). Press paste repeatedly to see multiple copies of these neurons appear. </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Delete neurons </span></p>

  
<p>Select all your neurons using "n", and press the delete button <img src="../Images/DeleteNeuron.png" height="18" width="18"> or the "backspace" or "delete" key. </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Connect one  neuron to another </span></p>

  
<p>1) Create two neurons. You will make a connection from a "source" to a "target" neuron. </p>

  
<p>2) Select the source neuron. Designate it a source neuron by selecting <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Set source neuron(s)</span> or pressing the "1" key, which is a shortcut for selecting source neurons. Observe the red halo that appears around the neuron.</p>

  
<p>3) Select the target neuron.</p>

  
<p>4) Connect the source to the target neuron using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Connect Source-Target &gt; All to all</span> or by pressing the "2" key. (After a while you can get quick at selecting, and using the "1" and "2" keys to connect neurons).</p>

  
<p>5) If you like, clear the "source neuron" halo by going to  <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Clear source neuron(s) </span>or by clicking outside any neurons or weights and pressing "1". <span class="command"><br>
</span></p>


  
<p><span class="heading">Add activation to  one neuron </span></p>

  
<p>Select the source neuron you just created. Press the "up" arrow button, and observe the value of the neuron change upwards.</p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Iterate a network </span></p>

  
<p>Iterate the network once. This can be done by clicking the <img src="../Images/Step.gif" height="18" width="18">
button in the desktop toolbar, or pressing the space-bar in the network
(these are slightly different operations, but we can ignore the
distinction for now). </p>

  
<p>Observe activation pass from the source to the target neuron. Iterate again and the activation clears out.</p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Select and randomize the weight </span> </p>

  
<p>
  </p>
<p>Select
the weight you created by clicking on it. If that is tricky, lasso over
the connection line. You can also press "w", which selects all weights.
A green halo will show up around the weight.</p>

  
<p>As with neurons, randomize by  pressing the randomize button <img src="../Images/Rand.png" height="18" width="18">
or pressing "r". Do this a few times to get a sense of what happens
when synapses are randomized. If they are positive their color is red;
if negative blue. The size of the weight is proportional the strength
of the synapse.</p>

  
<p>Having randomized this weight, again add
activation to the source neuron and iterate the network, to see that
the activation propagates differently. </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Make a layered network </span></p>

  
<p>Let's make a new network. Delete everything you've done up until now (press "a" to select all and delete to delete).<br>
</p>

  
<p>1. Make a row of neurons by pressing "P" a few times.</p>

  
<p>2. Copy and paste those neurons and move them right above the first neurons.</p>

  
<p>3. Repeat. You should now have three rows or "layers" of neurons.</p>

  
<p>4. Select the bottom row and make them source neurons using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Set source neuron(s)</span> or by pressing the "1" key.</p>

  
<p>5. Select the middle row and connect   using <span class="command">Edit &gt; Connect &gt; Connect Source-Target &gt; All to all</span> or by pressing the "2" key. </p>

  
<p>6. Now immediately make the middle row the new source neurons by pressing "1" while they are still selected</p>

  
<p>7. Select the final row and press "2" to connect.</p>

  
<p>8. Activate the bottom row by selecting those neurons and pressing the "R" button to randomize them.</p>

  
<p>9.Iterate the network a few times pressing the space-bar, to see activation propoagate through the network</p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Make a recurrent network </span></p>

  
<p>
  </p>
<p>1.
Make a grid of neurons using Insert &gt; Add Neurons... A dialog will
show up asking you how many neurons you want to create. Say 9 and press
OK.</p>

  
<p>2. Select all the neurons with "N"</p>

  
<p>3. Connect them all to themselves by pressing "1" then "2".&nbsp;&nbsp;
(This works because in step 2 they were designated as target neurons,
and by pressing "1" they were designated as source neurons, and&nbsp;
pressing "2" connected all source to all target neurons).<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span class="command"></span></p>

  
<p>4. Randomize the weights by first pressing "w" to select all weights, and then pressing "r" to randomize them.</p>

  
<p>5. Randomize the neurons by first pressing "n" to select all neurons, and then pressing "r" to randomize them.</p>

  
<p>6.
Iterate the network using the spacebar. Observe the changing behavior.
Periodically re-randomize the neurons using "N" followed by "R". </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Edit a few neurons </span></p>

  
<p>1. Select all the weights in your network by pressing "w" or using <span class="command">Select &gt; Edit Selected Neurons</span></p>

  
<p>2. Double click one of the neurons, or use <span class="command">Edit &gt; Edit Selected Neurons</span>. A neuron dialog will show up allowing you to edit these neurons. Change the update rule to <span class="command">Clamped</span>. </p>

  
<p>3. Randomize the network and iterate it, and observe that the neurons whose update rule is clamped do not change.</p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Edit  weights</span></p>

  
<p>1. Select all the weights in your network by pressing "W" or using <span class="command">Select &gt; Select All Weights. </span></p>

  
<p>2. Double click one of the synapses, or use <span class="command">Edit &gt; Edit Selected Synapse(s)</span>. A synapse dialog will show up allowing you to edit these weights. Change the learning rule to <span class="command">Hebbian</span>. </p>

  
<p>3. Randomize everything by using<span class="command"> Select &gt; Select All </span>or pressing "a" and then pressing "r" (this randomizes weights <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> neurons).</p>

  
<p>4. Press the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18">.
Periodically press "a" then "r" to re-randomize the network. Notice that
the weights slowly change their size, becuse they are learning using
the Hebb rule. </p>

  
<p><span class="heading">Create a bar chart </span></p>

  
<p>Don't delete the network you just created. We will now graph its activity using a bar chart. </p>

  
<p>1. Add a bar chart to the workspace using <span class="command">Desktop Menu: Insert &gt; New Plot &gt; Bar Chart</span> or by clicking on the plot menu button&nbsp;<img style="width: 18px; height: 18px;" alt="bar chart icon" src="../Images/BarChart.png"> in the desktop toolbar and selecting "Bar Chart"<br>
</p>

  
<p>2. Connect the network to the bar-chart <span class="command">Network Menu: Couple &gt; BarChart1</span>. </p>

  
  
<p>3. Iterate the workspace a few times the step button <img src="../Images/Step.gif" height="18" width="18"> , or run the workspace using the play button <img src="../Images/Play.gif" height="18" width="18">.
While it's running periodically reset the network using select all and
randomize ("A" then "R" while the network component is in focus), and
observe the changing pattern in the bar chart.<br>
