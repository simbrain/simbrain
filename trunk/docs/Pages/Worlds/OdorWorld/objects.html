  <h1>Objects</h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><img src="../../../Images/Swiss.gif" width="32" height="32"> Objects and Walls in the Odor World are stationary entities that act as a broadcasting center for a unique stimulus pattern, much like how a fine brie cheese disperses its odor around itself. How the signal disperses is reflective of the <a href="entitydialog.html#StimulusDispersion">decay function</a> established for that particular object.  </p>
  <p class="heading">Stimulus Dimensions</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the Odor World, there is a variable amount of Stimulus Dimensions, set by default to be 8. All objects broadcast customizable stimulus patterns during each iteration. These stimulus patterns are designed to be sensed by an <a href="agents.html">agent</a> when a neuron is coupled with it. A sensor can only receive only one dimension of the stimulus pattern at a time, so, except for sharing a signal dispersal, each stimulus value of an object is completely independent of other stimulus values. Since the total number of stimulus dimensions can be increased indefinitely, any number of descriptors can be used to signify the details of that particular object. Stimulus Values can be set in the <a href="entitydialog.html">Entity Dialogue</a></p>.
  </blockquote>
  <p class="heading">Miscellaneous Features</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span class="heading2">Edibility</span>: Objects have the ability to become <em>Edible</em>. This means that if an agent comes blocked by the object at hand, it will take some amount of iterations for the agent to eat the object. The number of iterations it takes for the object to become eaten is set by the <em>Bites to die</em> parameter.</p>
    <p><span class="heading2">Resurrection</span>: Objects also have the ability to be resurrected after it has been eaten by an agent. For each iteration after death, there will be some probability that the object will return to the Odor World. This probability is set by the <em>Resurrection Probability</em> parameter.
