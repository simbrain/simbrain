#summary Evaluating a Dataset Using PCA

== Background ==

Simbrain can be used to perform a cluster analysis on a set of data.   For a brief overview of what cluster analysis can be used for, see this page:

http://www.clustan.com/what_is_cluster_analysis.html

== Basic Process ==

* Open Simbrain * 

[]
 
* Insert  a dataworld *

_(Top Level Menu): Insert  > New World > DataWorld_

*Import your data*

_(Data World Menu): File > Import Data..._

This can be used to import a .csv file (comma-separated-values).  These files can be edited using Excel.   

* Configure dataworld *

Set dataworld to iterate mode: _(DataWorldMenu): Edit > Iteration Mode_

*  Insert a projection component *

_(Top Level Menu): Insert  > New Plot > Projection Plot_

Leave it set to PCA.  You can experiment with other projections after you've brought in all the data.

* Couple the dataworld component to projection*

_(Data World Menu): Couple  > Projection1_

Todo: explain here about how to set the right number of dimensions in the projection component.

* Do a run through the data by pressing global run *

Todo: explain here how to check that all the data has been run through.

== Analysis ==

The resulting set of points in the projection plot represent a projection of your data
